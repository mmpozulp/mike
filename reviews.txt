A Short History of Nearly Everything, Bill Bryson
An Exciting Survey of the Natural Sciences 4/5
The success of Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything lies in his ability to make the content of natural science serendipity as exciting and accessible as it rightly deserves to be. Some of the devices that he used to achieve exciting prose were dramatically effective. Some of the mechanisms that he used to achieve accessibility were a little tiresome. Ultimately, Bryson shows us why he deserves a spot in the literary canon of contemporary popular science.
Prior to reading Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything, I had never been excited by geology. Bryson changed my perception of geology by leveraging a powerful device that would prove thematic. The book is arranged as chronologically successive attempts at answering the most powerful questions of the natural sciences: Where do we come from? Are we alone? What are we made of?  Bryson creates an excitement about geology by asking the same questions that the upstanding membership of Victorian era geological societies excitedly sought to answer: How old is the Earth? What is the mass of the Earth? Has the Earth always looked the same? 
Bryson follows the standard popular-science storytelling format by providing miniaturized biographies for each of his historical characters. Bryson's excellent storytelling and articulated explanations obviate the need for any mathematical or symbolic descriptions. The only equation that Bryson shows is Newton's law of universal gravitation, "which is of course way beyond anything that most of us could make practical use of," Bryson says, "but at least we can appreciate that it is elegantly compact." Bryson has some other awkward moments where his work speaks exclusively to the non-technical, non-mathematical reader, such as the introduction. He spends four pages establishing a layperson ethos while standing amid the rubble of the fourth wall broken with an opening "Welcome." But this is less a criticism of his writing as subjective stylistic choices and the inherent difficulties confronting a superstar author in managing a huge and diverse readership.
Bryson's writing is otherwise always entertaining. When he laments the lack of researchers performing important taxonomical work on a particular microscopic aquatic animal of importance to some evolutionary biologists, he says of the researchers, "They can be found all over the world, but you could have all the bdelloid rotifer experts in the world to dinner and not have to borrow plates from the neighbors." Such accessible eloquence is perfect for the popular science genre. Bryson, instead of dubiously enumerating an unknown but small number of scientists, gives us some cute imagery. Save the accounting for the science. 
Still, after hearing so much from friends and fellow popular-science readers about Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything, I am glad to have read it. Even if a lot of the material was review, Bryson's expository talent makes it as fresh as the new.
