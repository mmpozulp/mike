Quesadilla Pie

2-3 cups cut-up chicken
3 (7 1/2") whole wheat tortillas
1 cup raw baby spinach
2 cups (16 oz jar) chunky salsa
1/4 cup low fat sour cream
1 1/2 cup shredded Mexican Blend cheese

Preheat oven to 375.

Combine chicken, 1 cup salsa, and sour cream in a large bowl. Spray a deep dish pie plate with Pam. Spread 1/2 cup salsa on bottom of pan.

Press 1 tortilla into pie plate; top with half the chicken mixture. Sprinkle with an even layer of cheese and half the spinach. Repeat, reserving about 1/4 cup of cheese. Top with final tortilla; spread with remaining 1/2 cup salsa and sprinkle with cheese.

Cover with foil; bake 20-30 minutes. Remove foil and bake 5 more minutes or until cheese melts. Let sit a few minutes and slice into wedges.
