1. If using dried beans, place them together in a bowl or other container, add 2.5 qt / 2.5 L water, cover, and refrigerate overnight. The next day, drain and rinse the beans. In a large saucepan, bring the beans and about 2.5 qt / 2.5 L fresh water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the beans are tender. Remove from the heat and drain the beans, reserving the cooking liquid. Set the beans and liquid aside separately. If using canned beans, drain, rinse under cold running water, and set aside.\
\
2. In the stockpot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, celery, sweet potato, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the vegetables start to soften, the onion starts to turn translucent, and you can smell the vegetables cooking. Add the drained beans, corn, green chiles, tomatoes, and 4 cups / 460 mL of the bean cooking liquid, or water if you have used canned beans, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the vinegar, brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, cocoa powder, cayenne, salt, and white pepper. Stir until well mixed and bring back to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the mixture thickens a bit.\

3. The chili can be ladled into bowls and served immediately, or it can be cooled, covered, and refrigerated overnight to develop flavor and texture. It can also be stored in an airtight container in the fridge of rip to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.\
