Southwestern-Style Lasagna

1 package lasagna noodles
1 small package shredded sharp cheddar cheese
6 roasted hot green chili, peeled and de-seeded
2 green bell peppers
1 can diced tomatoes with green chilis
4 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast
3 can black beans
1 can corn
1 small jar of salsa

Preheat the oven to 350F. Procure two ~8 1/2 by 11 baking dishes.

Boil about 5 quarts of water in a pot. Add lasagna noodles and cook for 8 minutes or until al dente. Drain and hang/lay noodles flat.

Pan fry chicken breasts in a lightly-greased skillet on high heat. After 30-45 minutes or when the breasts are completely white inside (no longer pink), move to cutting board and dice to 1/2 pieces.

Chop green bell peppers into tiny 1/8 cubes. Chop roasted green chili to similar size. Find the largest bowl in your kitchen and combine chopped pepper and chili with drained/washed black beans, corn, and chicken. Mix.

Spread diced tomatoes on bottom of baking dishes. Layer in the following order
-lasagna noodles
-salsa
-mixed peppers, chili, beans, corn, chicken
-cheese
completing only two layers per dish. Cover in aluminum foil and bake for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted.
