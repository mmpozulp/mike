Originally done with Terre Smith who found the recipe here "http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/curried-chicken-and-vegetable-pan-roast"

2 lbs butternut squash in 1-inch cubes
1.5 libs brussel sprouts, halved
2 large red onions, cut into thin wedges
3/4 cup canola oil
Salt and freshly ground pepper
1 cup plain low-fat Greek yogurt
2 tbs minced fresh ginger
1 head garlic, chopped
4 pounds chicken breasts
1 lb asparagus, choped
Spice Island curry powder
Patak's Original Concentrated Curry Paste Hot (Tastes of India)
cinnamon
cayenne pepper
cumin

1. Preheat oven to 450 and position racks in the upper and middle thirds. In 12-court sauce pot (or huge bowl), toss butternut squash with brussel sprouts, onion wedges, and 1/2 cup canola oil, season with salt and pepper. Spread vegetables on 2 large, sturdy rimmed baking sheet.

2. In the same bowl, combine the cup of yogurt with the ginger, garlic, curry powder, curry paste, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, cumin, and 1/4 cup of oil and season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken and toss until thoroughly coated. Arrange the chicken on top of the vegetables. Roast for about 50 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through, until the vegetables are nearly tender and the chicken is nearly cooked through. Add on asparagus and cook 10 minutes longer, until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is lightly browned. Transfer the chicken and vegetables to platter and serve with yogurt mixed with curry paste.
