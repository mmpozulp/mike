\
1/2 cup quinoa\
2 tsp olive oil\
2 red bell pepper\
2 broccoli crown\
3 container mushrooms\
4 Tbs peanut butter\
2 limes\
2 Tbs water\
1 tsp tamari (or soy sauce)\
1 tsp brown sugar\
1 tsp grated ginger\
salt + pepper to taste\
2 containers extra firm tofu\
4 Tbs chopped roasted peanuts\

Baked tofu\
2 Tbs tamari (or soy sauce)\
2 Tbs maple syrup\
2 Tbs olive oil\
1 head garlic, chopped\
a pinch ground pepper\
2 packages extra-firm tofu, drained, pressed for 30 minutes, and sliced or chopped\
\
1. Combine tamari, maple syrup, olive oil, garlic, and pepper in a dish. Place tofu in dish and marinate for 30 minutes, flipping the tofu after 15 minutes. The tofu should soak up almost all the marinade.\
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with oil or cooking spray or line it with parchment paper; place the tofu on the baking sheet and bake for about 40 minutes, or until edges are dark and tofu is chewy, turning tofu over halfway through cooking time.}
