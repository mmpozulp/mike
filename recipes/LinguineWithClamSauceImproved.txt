-----------------
1 medium red onion 
1 head garlic
1/2 lb asparagus 
1/2 bundle green onion
2 roma tomatoes
2 big red bell peppers
6 cans chopped clams
2 bags spinach
1/2 cup oil
1/2 cup cilantro
pepper medley
red pepper flakes
1.5 box of whole wheat linguine

Chop and sauté onion on medium heat in a big pan or wok. After 10 minutes or once onion becomes translucent, add chopped garlic. After 10 minutes add finely chopped asparagus, chopped roma tomatoes, chopped red bell peppers. Cook 5 minutes then add 6 cans of clams, 4 of them drained of their juice. Add green onion, cilantro, and season with several tablespoons of pepper medley and red pepper flakes. Add no salt - there is enough in the 2 cans' worth of clam juice. Cook linguine al dente (5-8 minutes) and serve.
