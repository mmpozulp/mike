Arròs Caldós (soupy paella)

I made this the other night. I think I showed you the recipe. Very tasty.

2 T. Olive oil
medium onion, chopped
1 pinch saffron
1 t.  finely chopped fresh rosemary
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
4 oz mushrooms, cleaned and cut into bite size pieces
2 oz chorizo, halved lengthwise and sliced into half moons
1 can diced tomatoes
5-6 cups chicken or veggie stock
Salt
Meat from 1/2 rotisserie chicken, torn into bite size pieces
1 cup short grain rice
Zest and juice of 1/2 lemon
1 1/2 cups baby spinach leaves

Heat oil in a heavy pot over low-medium heat. Saute onions until translucent and soft, about 7 minutes. Stir in saffron, rosemary, and garlic and cook until aromatic, 1-2 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and stir in mushrooms and chorizo. Saute until browned, 1-2 minutes. Add tomatoes and simmer about 5 minutes.

Increase heat to high and add stock to pot. Bring to a vigorous boil and season with salt. Stir in chicken and rice. Boil, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes. Stir in lemon zest. Cook until rice is al dente, 3-5 minutes more. Stir in spinach and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Turn off heat and season with lemon juice and salt to taste. I think I actually cooked it longer because I like softer rice. If it gets thick just add more stock.
