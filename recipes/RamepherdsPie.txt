Ramepherd's Pie

Start by cooking a half pound of ground beef in a large skillet with a bit of oil. Add a half cup of choped onion along with half of the seasoning packet and a bit of water. Add some frozen peas, season to taste with salt and pepper, then transfer to a pie plate, a gratin dish, or a cast iron skillet. Top with cooked ramen noodles, then broil until brown and crispy on top.
