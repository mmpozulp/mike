\
Beware that this does NOT fit into a 7 qt crock pot all at once. You have to feed ingredients in as they cook down. A better idea would have been to get a larger crock pot, at least 10 qt.\
\
2 large yellow onions, chopped\
3 large leeks\
3 carrots, peeled and chopped\
1 large butternut squash, peeled, seeded and chopped into small squares\
2 apples, peeled and chopped\
2 cups low sodium vegetable broth\
1 tsp ground coriander\
1 tsp ground cumin\
1 tsp dried thyme\
1 tsp ground sage\
plain yogurt and tortilla chips for serving\
\
1. Add all ingredients to a crock pot and cook on high for 8 hours. If everything does not fit, the order to add them is vegetableBroth/onion/apple/squash/carrots/leeks.\
2. Optionally, you can blend the soup in a food processor after it finishes cooking.\
3. Serve with plain yogurt and tortilla chips.}
