Roughly triple recipe from "http://vegangela.com/2013/02/18/oven-baked-mexican-quinoa-casserole/"
Serves 12-15

3 onions
1 head garlic
2.5 cups uncooked quinoa
4 x 14.5oz diced tomatoes, with liquid
1/2 cup water
3 Tbs tomato paste
2 Tbs cumin
2 Tbs oregano
1.5 Tbs chili powder
Salt & freshly ground pepper
5 cans black beans, rinsed and drained
+2 cans white beans if desired
1 can corn, with liquid
10 cups spinach
4 tofu
4 Tbs nutritional yeast
4 jalapeño or green chilis
3 avocado
cilantro
hot sauce

0. Cube and boil tofu.

1. Preheat oven to 350F

2. Saute onion, garlic, peppers on high heat until brown. Remove from heat.

3. Add quinoa, diced tomatoes (with juice), water, tomato paste, and spices. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.

4. Halfway fill (to leave space) as many oven-safe casserole dishes as necessary (we required 3 large dishes) and place in oven and set timer for 30 minutes.

5. Carefully remove casserole from oven and stir in drained beans and corn (with liquid). If the mixture looks dry, add a half cup of water.

6. Return to oven and set timer for another 30 minutes.

7. Carefully remove casserole from oven and stir in spinach. It will wilt from the heat.

8. Crumble tofu over casserole. 

9. Top with diced avocado and/or cilantro and serve with hot sauce.

10. IF FREEZING, Make full recipe but leave-out the spinach and toppings. Let cool and freeze in airtight container(s). To serve: defrost fully, lightly reheat (in microwave or on stovetop), stir in spinach and add toppings of choice.
