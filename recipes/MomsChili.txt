-----------------
1 can diced tomatoes
1 can stewed tomatoes
1 can tomato soup
1 can (small) v8 juice
1 can black beans
1 box farfalle/penne pasta
2 ears corn
2.5 lb 97% lean ground sirloin
2 big onions
2 big green bell peppers
4 stalks celery
chili powder
ground pepper medley

Saute ground sirloin in pan with onion, peppers; cook until meat is brown and onions clear, then pour off excess grease. In a separate pan lightly sautee celery so it maintains its crunch. Husk and then boil corn in a pot of water.

In a large pot combine diced tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, tomato soup, v8 juice, black beans, corn, and celery with the meat, onion, and peppers. Add chili powder to taste (3-4 tbs) and ground pepper then heat.

Cook the pasta and serve chili on bed of farfalle/penne with cheese and sour cream.
