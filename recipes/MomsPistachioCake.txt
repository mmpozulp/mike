-----------------
2 3.4oz (96g) pistachio pudding boxes
1 packet Dream Whip
1 box Duncan Hines yellow cake mix (3 eggs, 1 cup water, 1/2 cup vegetable oil)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine ingredients in large bowl and mix until consistent throughout but no more (want to keep the cake dense by avoiding aeration resulting from over-mixing). Pour into greased bunt cake pan and bake until top is crusty brown and inserting a knife leaves no cake-trace on the blade (approx. directions on cake mix box). Let cool and serve with ice cream and cool whip if necessary, bur preferably without frosting.
