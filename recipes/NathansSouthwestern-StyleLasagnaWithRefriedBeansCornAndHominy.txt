\f0\fs24 \cf0 Southwestern-Style Lasagna with Refried Beans, Corn, and Hominy\
from \ul Supermarket Vegan\ulnone \

\i \
Refried black beans can replace the standard pinto bean variety, if desired. Serve with a tossed green salad for a well-balanced meal.\

\i0 \
1 tablespoon canola oil\
1 cup drained canned white hominy\
1 cup cooked fresh or frozen yellow corn\
4 scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced\
Garlic salt, to taste\
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste\
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro,\
1 (16-ounce) can vegetarian refried beans\
2 cups chunky mild or medium salsa\
6 oven-ready lasagna noodles\
1/2 cup crushed tortilla chips\
\
Preheat the oven to 375F. Lightly grease an 8-inch-square baking dish and set aside.\
\
In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the hominy, corn, scallions, garlic salt, and pepper; cook, stirring, until scallions are softened and mixture is fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and toss with the cilantro. Set aside.\
\
In a small bowl, mix together the refried beans and 1 cup of the salsa until well blended. Set aside.\
\
Spread 1/2 cup of the remaining salsa along the bottom of the prepared baking dish; top with 2 noodles (break, if necessary, to fit). Spread half of the bean mixture on top of the noodles. Top the bean mixture with half of the hominy mixture. Top the hominy mixture with 2 more noodles. Top the noodles with the remaining bean mixture, followed by the remaining hominy mixture. Top with the remaining 2 noodles. Top the noodles with the remaining salsa.\
\
Cover the baking dish with foil (lightly oil the underside if foil will touch the salsa) and bake 35 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle evenly with the crushed tortilla chips. Bake another 5 minutes, until topping is lightly browned. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting. Serve warm.}
