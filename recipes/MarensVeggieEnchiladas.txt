Jody's Quick Tomato Sauce

2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 lb (500 g) plum (Roma) tomatoes, seeded and coarsely chopped
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons finely sliced fresh basil leaves
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf (Italian) parsley
salt and freshly ground pepper

In a frying pan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the garlic and, when it sizzles, stir in the tomatoes and sugar. Saute, stirring, just until the tomatoes' juices begin to thicken, 5-7 minutes. Stir in the basil and parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Makes about 1 + 1/2 cups (12 fl oz/375 ml)

Then serve it on top of a leftover-grilled-vegetable frittata.
