Spinach Mostaccioli

Cook 8 oz penne (or mostaccioli) pasta according to directions; drain and rinse in cold water

Cook 10 oz pkg of frozen chopped spinach until just thawed out (no icy clumps); drain well so it is not too watery.

After pasta is drained, I put it back in the pot it was cooked in and add 1 jar (about 26 oz size) of spaghetti sauce, and about 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese. Stir to coat pasta.

Spray a pan with Pam and add a layer of pasta, then a layer of spinach, then a layer of mozzarella cheese (probably about a cup or so). Repeat the layers of pasta and spinach, but hold back the cheese until later. Cover with foil. Bake at 375 degrees for 30-45 minutes (this is a guess because I cook a big pan of this and it takes an hour or more); basically it should start to be bubbly when it is almost done. Take the foil off and add the last layer of cheese and put back in the oven just long enough to melt the cheese.

If you want to make a big pan (9 x 13"), then just double the amounts.
