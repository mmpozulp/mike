                        <p>
			    The Jobprobe is a multi-platform desktop application that 
                            provides a dynamic graphical display of
                            computation processes ("jobs") running on a computer 
                            cluster. The back-end, written in C, is a daemon process that 
                            periodically queries the job scheduler for its list of jobs. This
                            job data is sent up to a server, written in Java, and then sent out to
                            instances of the client, a Java Swing GUI. It is similar to 
                            <a href=#nodeprobe> the Nodeprobe</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The image on this page is a screenshot of the Jobprobe client showing
                            the jobs running on 
                            <a href="http://www.hpc.wm.edu/SciClone/Home">
                                William &amp; Mary's SciClone Cluster</a>. 
                            The top part of the display shows what jobs are running on which nodes,
                            each node in the cluster represented by a square.
                            The bottom part is a sortable list of all the jobs running on the cluster.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Jobprobe was originally developed by Andrew Otto at William &amp; Mary 
                            in 2004. By the time I got to it in 2012, the Jobprobe was dead.
                            My first job was porting the backend from Sparc/Solaris to x86/Linux. 
                            This was largely a problem of swapping function calls, endianness, and other 
                            eccentricities of platform specificity. After the port, I added features to the 
                            client like column sorting and authentication. I also swapped around some of the 
                            icon assignment logic in the server.

                            The Jobprobe provides an enormous amount of utility to users of clusters. 
                            Cluster computing isn't new, but it is constantly evolving with new
                            technologies. Cluster-monitoring tool development is a dynamic and
                            rewarding enterprise.

			    The Nodeprobe is a multi-platform desktop application that 
                            provides a dynamic graphical display of node data statistics. 
                            The back-end, written in C, is a daemon process that runs on 
                            every node and gathers information about cpu and memory usage,
                            paging, interrupts, load averages, disk I/O, and disk space. This
                            data is sent up to a server, written in Java, and then sent out to
                            instances of the client, a Java Swing GUI. It is similar to 
                            <a href=#jobprobe> the Jobprobe</a>.
                        </p>

                            The image on this page is a screenshot of the Nodeprobe client showing
                            the cluster of nodes on
                            <a href="http://www.hpc.wm.edu/SciClone/Home">
                                William &amp; Mary's SciClone Cluster</a>. 
                            Each square is an individual node.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Nodeprobe was originally developed by Andrew Otto at William &amp; Mary 
                            in 2004. By the time I got to it in 2013, the Nodeprobe was dead.
                            My first job was porting the backend from Sparc/Solaris to x86/Linux. 
                            On Solaris, node statistics were collected using system calls. The Linux 
                            paradigm requires you read from /proc to get the same data. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Linux port was challenging. Since the daemon ran on every node, performance
                            considerations were of critical importance. During development I always compiled
                            timing code to monitor my
                            time. I learned a lot about the peculiarities of the /proc pseudo-filesystem, 
                            and found that reading /proc on brand-new Linux machines is slower than making 
                            system calls on 10-year-old Sun hardware in order to retrieve the same data. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also learned about LKMs, having to use them with the lm-sensors library to 
                            access hardware temperature sensor data, overclock the CPU, and control fan
                            speed (just kidding about the last two, my boss said I was not allowed to 
                            void the warranty of a million dollars worth of computer hardware).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Nodeprobe provides an enormous amount of utility. It can tell you if a node
                            has a broken fan, if an application is page thrashing, if an application is CPU-
                            or IO-bound, if a disk is full, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I will shortly be working on folding the Jobprobe into the Nodeprobe.
                            As of right now, the two applications are used concurrently, but it
                            should be possible to integrated the Jobprobe as a "Jobs" tab in the 
                            Nodeprobe.

                            The Contest challenged interns to see who could get the most
                            Facebook likes for their poster in three days.

                            Posterankr is an outgrowth of my poster contest campaign,
                            an effort described in detail in my first blog post.
                            Posterankr offers like-count ordinality to the hundreds of otherwise-unranked
                            posters.
                            Its simple interface consists of Boostrap and static html. It uses the Facebook 
                            Graph API to get like counts, photos, and links.

                            Billboard Top 100 Music Player (BTMP) is a desktop client that 
                            lets you listen to the Top 100 on your desktop. Without advertisements.
                            For free.

                        <p>
                            It works by downloading the Top 100 list from the Billboard RSS feed,
                            then uses the Youtube API, youtube-dl, and ffmpeg to download and
                            convert videos to mp3 for each of the Top 100. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The interface is a list of the Top 100, sortable by rank, title,
                            and artist. It is also a fully-capable mp3 player, allowing the
                            user to listen to the list.

                            you can go to listen to Top 100 music, including the 
                            <a href="http://www.billboard.com/">Billboard website</a>. 
                            You could even turn on the radio. The advantage of BTMP is that 
                            it provides a clean interface with a minimum featureset. 
                            It's also free/libre and open source.

                            The Judge's Station is a multi-vehicle ground station that tracks and controls
                            unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs). It was written to score a UAV-focused NASA 
                            Centennial Challenge. It displays the position and other data associated with
                            UAVs operating in the airspace. It also generates mission for competitors,
                            scores competitors, maintains range safety, and commands UAVs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Judge's Station communicates with the UAVs over a radio telemetry link
                            using the MAVLINK communications protocol. It is compatible with
                            any autopilots implementing MAVLINK. We at NASA chose ardupilot.
