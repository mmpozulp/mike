                        <p>
			    The Jobprobe is a multi-platform desktop application that 
                            provides a dynamic graphical display of
                            computation processes ("jobs") running on a computer 
                            cluster. The back-end, written in C, is a daemon process that 
                            periodically queries the job scheduler for its list of jobs. This
                            job data is sent up to a server, written in Java, and then sent out to
                            instances of the client, a Java Swing GUI. It is similar to 
                            <a href=#nodeprobe> the Nodeprobe </a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The image on this page is a screenshot of the Jobprobe client showing
                            the jobs running on 
                            <a href="http://www.hpc.wm.edu/SciClone/Home">
                                William &amp; Mary's SciClone Cluster</a>. 
                            The top part of the display shows what jobs are running on which nodes,
                            each node in the cluster represented by a square.
                            The bottom part is a sortable list of all the jobs running on the cluster.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Jobprobe was originally developed by Andrew Otto at William &amp; Mary 
                            in 2004. By the time I got to it in 2012, the Jobprobe was dead.
                            My first job was porting the backend from Sparc/Solaris to x86/Linux. 
                            This was largely a problem of swapping function calls, endianness, and other 
                            eccentricities of platform specificity. After the port, I added features to the 
                            client like column sorting and authentication. I also swapped around some of the 
                            icon assignment logic in the server.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Jobprobe provides an enormous amount of utility to users of clusters. 
                            Cluster computing isn't new, but given its birth in the 90s it's still
                            young enough that cluster tool development is a productive enterprise.

			    The Nodeprobe is a multi-platform desktop application that 
                            provides a dynamic graphical display of node data statistics. 
                            The back-end, written in C, is a daemon process that runs on 
                            every node and gathers information about cpu and memory usage,
                            paging, interrupts, load averages, disk I/O, and disk space. This
                            data is sent up to a server, written in Java, and then sent out to
                            instances of the client, a Java Swing GUI. It is similar to 
                            <a href=#jobprobe> the Jobprobe </a>.

                            the cluster of nodes on
                            <a href="http://www.hpc.wm.edu/SciClone/Home">

                            Each square is an individual node.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Nodeprobe was originally developed by Andrew Otto at William &amp; Mary 
                            in 2004. By the time I got to it in 2013, the Nodeprobe was dead.
                            My first job was porting the backend from Sparc/Solaris to x86/Linux. 
                            On Solaris, node statistics were collected using system calls. The Linux 
                            paradigm requires you read from /proc to get the same data. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Linux port was challenging. Since the daemon ran on every node, performance
                            considerations were of critical importance. During development I always compiled
                            timing code so I could see whether or not I was actively reducing execution 
                            time. I learned a lot about the peculiarities of the /proc pseudo-filesystem, 
                            and found that reading /proc on brand-new Linux machines is slower than making 
                            system calls on 10-year-old Sun hardware. I also learned about LKMs, having to
                            use them with the lm-sensors library to access hardware temperature sensor data.
                        </p>

                            The Nodeprobe provides an enormous amount of utility. It can tell you if a node
                            has a broken fan, if an application is page thrashing, if a node is out of memory,
                            and much much more.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        I will shortly be working on folding the Jobprobe into the Nodeprobe.
                        As of right now, the two applications are used concurrently, but it
                        should be possible to integrated the Jobprobe as a "Jobs" tab in the 
                        Nodeprobe.
