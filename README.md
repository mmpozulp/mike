Here are all the files for my personal website, hosted using gh-pages. 
I use Bootstrap 3.0 for the core css and js elements. I started out with the
attractive "Stanley Freelancer Theme" from http://www.blacktie.co/2014/01/stanley-freelancer-theme/
and have been editing it for my own purposes. Everything is static html.

I wrote python scripts to build the books page from a template and content files which contain
chronological lists of books that I have read and reviewed. I'm planning on doing the same
for a recipes page.
