This is my website hosted on gh-pages. It consists of static webpages
using Bootstrap 3.0 for the core css and js elements.
I started out with the attractive "Stanley Freelancer Theme" from 
http://www.blacktie.co/2014/01/stanley-freelancer-theme/.

I use python scripts to build the books and recipeps pages from template and content files.
